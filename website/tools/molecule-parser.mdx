[Rfc-008](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/rfcs/blob/e419bb7ea79ebf996a104b1a7e844c792c8ab3c5/rfcs/0008-serialization/0008-serialization.md) has defined the data serialization standard on CKB.  

This tool provides an online decoder for serialized data with known schemas.

Since it is very commonly used on chain, we have added [blockchain.mol](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb/blob/5a7efe7a0b720de79ff3761dc6e8424b8d5b22ea/util/types/schemas/blockchain.mol) as built-in schemas to this tool.
