The CKB2021 address format has [changed from bech32 to bech32m](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/rfcs/pull/239),
we recommend developers to use the new format in your dApps.
This tool will help you determine if an address is deprecated or new.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="address2script" label="Address to Script" default>
    <AddressToScript />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="script2address" label="Script to Address">
    <ScriptToAddress />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
