# Lumos Works with MetaMask

Nervos maintains a powerful lock
called [Omnilock](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/rfcs/blob/master/rfcs/0042-omnilock/0042-omnilock.md) (previously named RC lock), which
can use MetaMask as a signer. This example will show how to use Lumos to send a transaction using Omnilock and MetaMask

## Quick Start

> we should [build](..) Lumos project first before we start this example

```
npm run build
npm run build-release
cd examples/omni-lock-metamask
npm start
```
