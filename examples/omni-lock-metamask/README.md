Nervos maintains a powerful lock called Omni Lock(previously named RC lock), which can use MetaMask as a signer.
This example will show how to use Lumos to send a transaction using Omni lock and MetaMask

## Quick Start

> we should [build](..) Lumos project first before we start the example,

yarn install
